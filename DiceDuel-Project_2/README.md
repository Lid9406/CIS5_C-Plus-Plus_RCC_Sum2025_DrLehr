# ðŸŽ² DiceDuel (v2.0 â€“ v2.9)  
**Project 2 â€“ CIS-5: C++ Programming**  
**Instructor: Dr. Lehr**  
**Student: Matthew D. Anderson**  
**Term: Summer 2025 â€“ Riverside City College**

---

## ðŸš€ Description  
**DiceDuel** is a console-based, two-player dice game developed in 10 iterative versions (v2.0 through v2.9). The project emphasizes modular design, input validation, structured logic enhancement, and version control. Each iteration introduces new features and C++ conceptsâ€”from ternary logic and sorting algorithms to function overloading and search capabilities.

The project integrates:
- Lehr-style flowcharting via Microsoft Visio  
- Screenshot audit trails and checklist tagging  
- Structured pseudocode and documentation alignment  
- Strategic planning across logic categories (input, output, storage, and memory)

## ðŸ”Ž Implementation Highlights  

- Dynamic input validation across replay and data entry  
- Audit-traceable flowcharts for `main()` and submodules  
- Bubble and selection sort logic in modular blocks  
- Use of `srand(time(0))` for randomized gameplay and arrays  
- `version_notes.txt` tracks logic evolution between versions  
- Tags (`M1`â€“`M6`) used for checklist alignment and instructor clarity  

---

## ðŸ§  Flowchart Design  

Each version includes Lehr-style flowcharts with:
- Logical separation across pages  
- Proper terminal, decision, input/output, and process symbols  
- Page tracking for `main()`, `PlayRound()`, `SortScores()`, and `SearchStats()`  
- Connector nodes for cross-page transitions when applicable

## ðŸ“… Author Notes  

This project was developed by **Matthew D. Anderson** during Summer 2025 at Riverside City College, under instruction from **Dr. Lehr**. It reflects iterative growth in C++ fluency, adherence to flowchart design principles, and strategic modular refinement.

Project artifacts were built to meet both instructional standards and personal design benchmarks, with future expansion ideas including:
- Recursive sorting experiments  
- Class-based encapsulation  
- File I/O logging and replay restoration  
- Score tracking via dynamic storage containers
